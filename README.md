# Drinks Vending Machine

A Graphical application that simulates a hot-drinks vending machine.
The machine should offer different types of hot drinks, (tea, coffee, chocolate drink...),
each with its own name, price and preparation method.
Clients choose their preferred drink and the machine should prepare it.

General Considerations:

The GUI show the types of drinks available.

Show what happens if a drink is selected, but cannot be made (no cups, no more sugar, drink not available, etc).

New drinks are added to the machine from time to time.
So Build a general mechanism to support these adaptations.
